## Project Motivation
The main purpose of this project was developing my skills as a Data Scientist, the goal was to answer three questions:
1 - How does number of rooms, beds and guests affects our price?
2 - What are the most common amenities? And the most important for pricing?
3 - And lastly, how important is location in Rio de Janeiro?


## Results
