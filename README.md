# Project1-Udacity

## Installation
Most of the libraries are in the Anaconda package. You will need to enter your own token for mapbox, here is some documentation on how to do it https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/

## Project Motivation
The main purpose of this project was developing my skills as a Data Scientist, the goal was to answer three questions:
1 - How does number of rooms, beds and guests affects our price?
2 - What are the most common amenities? And the most important for pricing?
3 - And lastly, how important is location in Rio de Janeiro?

The files included are avaiable from AirBnB data - http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here - https://francisco-nania.medium.com/how-to-price-your-place-on-airbnb-9ffcd6f8bf31
